(Non)linear multivariate, multilevel modeling via Stan

The brms package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized
(non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan. The formula
syntax is very similar to that of the package `lme4` to provide a
familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A
wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing
users to fit -- among others -- linear, robust linear, count data,
survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even
self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context.

brms allows users to specify models via the customary R commands, where

* <p>models are specified with formula syntax,</p>
* <p>data is provided as a data frame, and</p>
* <p>additional arguments are available to specify priors and
additional structure.</p>

Estimation is carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo using Stan
programs generated on the fly and compiled.
