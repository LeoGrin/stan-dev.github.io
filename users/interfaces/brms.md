(Non)linear multivariate, multilevel modeling via Stan

The brms package provides a flexible interface to fit Bayesian generalized
(non)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan.

brms allows users to specify models via the customary R commands, where

* <p>models are specified with formula syntax,</p>
* <p>data is provided as a data frame, and</p>
* <p>additional arguments are available to specify priors and
additional structure.</p>

Estimation may be carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational
inference using Stan programs generated on the fly and compiled. Graphical
posterior predictive checking, leave-one-out cross-validation, and posterior
visualization are tightly integrated.
