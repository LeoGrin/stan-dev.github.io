statistical analysis with Stan

# Interfaces and Installation

In order to facilitate inference, Stan provides both a modeling language
for specifying complex statistical models and a library of statistical
algorithms for computing inferences with those models.  These components
are exposed through interfaces in environments such as R, Python, and the
command line.

To get started with Stan head over to our interfaces page where you will
find documentation and installation instructions about each of our interfaces:

* <p><a href="/users/interfaces/index.html">Stan Interfaces</a></p>

# Documentation, Tutorials, and Case Studies

Already playing with Stan in your favorite computing environment?
Then it's time to put Stan to use and fit some models!  For information
on the Stan modeling language as well as tutorials, case studies, and examples,
head over to our documentation page,

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/index.html">Stan Documentation</a></p>

# Contact Us

If you're looking for help with installing Stan, coding and debugging Stan
programs, Bayesian inference in general, or just want to let everyone know
what you're doing with Stan then please post to the Stan Forums,

* <p><a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
