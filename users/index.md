statistical analysis with Stan

# Interfaces and Installation

In order to facilitate inference, Stan provides both a modeling language
for specifying complex statistical models and a library of statistical
algorithms for computing inferences with those models.  These components
are exposed through interfaces in environments such as R, Python, and the
command line.

To get started with Stan head over to our [interfaces](/users/interfaces/)
page where you will find documentation and installation instructions about
each of our interfaces.

# Documentation and Tutorials

Already playing with Stan in your favorite computing environment?
Then it's time to put Stan to use and fit some models!  For information
on the Stan modeling language as well as tutorials, case studies, and examples,
head over to our [documentation](/users/documentation/) page.

# Contact Us

If you're looking for help with installing Stan, coding and debugging Stan
programs, Bayesian inference in general, or just want to let everyone know
what you're doing with Stan then please post to the Stan Forums,

* <a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
<span class="note">(Discourse)</span>

Everyone who joins the forum has posting privileges.  We love hearing about
application of Stan and we try very hard to be as helpful as possible, so
