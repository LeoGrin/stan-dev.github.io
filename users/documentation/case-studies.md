## Spatial Models in Stan: Intrinsic Auto-Regressive Models for Areal Data

<small>
This case study shows how to efficiently encode and compute an
Intrinsic Conditional Auto-Regressive (ICAR) model in Stan.
When data has a neighborhood structure, ICAR models provide spatial smoothing
by averaging measurements of directly adjoining regions.
The Besag, York, and Mollié (BYM) model is a Poisson GLM which
includes both an ICAR component and an ordinary
random-effects component for non-spatial heterogeneity.
We compare two variants of the BYM model and fit two datasets
taken from epidemiological studies over 56 and 700 regions, respectively.

## Typical Sets and the Curse of Dimensionality

<small> This case study illustrates the so-called “curse of
dimensionality” using simple examples based on simulation to show that
all points are far away in high dimensions and that the mode is an
atypical draw from a multivariate normal.  The information-theoretic
concept of typical set is illustrated with both discrete and
continuous cases, which show that probability mass is a product of
volume and density (or count and mass in the discrete case).  It also
illustrates Monte Carlo methods and relates distance to the log
density of the normal distribution and the chi-squared distribution.

## A Primer on Bayesian Multilevel Modeling using PyStan

<small>
This case study replicates the analysis of home radon levels using
hierarchical models of [Lin, Gelman, Price, and Kurtz
(1999)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~radon/credits.html).  It
illustrates how to generalize linear regressions to hierarchical models with
group-level predictors and how to compare predictive inferences and
evaluate model fits. Along the way it shows how to get data into Stan
using pandas, how to sample using PyStan, and how to visualize the results
using Seaborn.

## The Impact of Reparameterization on Point Estimates

<small> When changing variables, a Jacobian adjustment needs to be
provided to account for the rate of change of the transform. Applying
the adjustment ensures that inferences that are based on expectations
over the posterior are invariant under reparameterizations. In
contrast, the posterior mode changes as a result of the
reparameterization. In this note, we use Stan to code a repeated
binary trial model parameterized by chance of success, along with its
reparameterization in terms of log odds in order to demonstrate the
effect of the Jacobian adjustment on the Bayesian posterior and the
posterior mode. We contrast the posterior mode to the maximum
likelihood estimate, which, like the Bayesian estimates, is invariant
under reparameterization. Along the way, we derive the logistic
distribution by transforming a uniformly distributed variable.

## Two-Parameter Logistic Item Response Model

<small>This tutorial introduces the R package edstan for estimating
two-parameter logistic item response models using Stan without knowing
the Stan language. Subsequently, the tutorial explains how the model
can be expressed in the Stan language and fit using the rstan
package. Specification of prior distributions and assessment of
convergence are discussed. Using the Stan language directly has the
advantage that it becomes quite easy to extend the model, and this is
demonstrated by adding a latent regression and differential item
functioning to the model. Posterior predictive model checking is also
demonstrated.</small>

## Pooling with Hierarchical Models for Repeated Binary Trials

<small>This note illustrates the effects on posterior inference of
pooling data (aka sharing strength) across items for repeated binary
trial data.  It provides Stan models and R code to fit and check
predictive models for three situations: (a) complete pooling, which
assumes each item is the same, (b) no pooling, which assumes the items
are unrelated, and (c) partial pooling, where the similarity among the
items is estimated.  We consider two hierarchical models to estimate
the partial pooling, one with a beta prior on chance of success and
another with a normal prior on the log odds of success.  The note
explains with working examples how to (i) fit models in RStan and plot
the results in R using ggplot2, (ii) estimate event probabilities,
(iii) evaluate posterior predictive densities to evaluate model
predictions on held-out data, (iv) rank items by chance of success,
(v) perform multiple comparisons in several settings, (vi) replicate
new data for posterior p-values, and (vii) perform graphical posterior
predictive checks. </small>
