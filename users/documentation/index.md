# Stan Language Reference Manual

The manual for Stan's programming language for coding probability models,
inference algorithms for fitting models and making predictions,
and posterior analysis tools for evaluating the results.
This manual applies to all Stan interfaces.

# Stan Language Functions Reference

The reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.
For release 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the Stan Language Reference Manual.

# Bayesian Statistics Using Stan

This book is is the official user's guide for Stan.  It provides example
models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
It also serves as an example-driven introduction to Bayesian modeling
and inference.
For release 2.18, this is titled _Stan User's Guide_.
For release 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the Stan Language Reference Manual.

# Wiki Documentation

The Stan Wiki is largely focused on development documentation but it also
includes a few pages with helpful information for users.

Two particularly recommended pages are

# Tutorials

The Stan development team and many users have contributed tutorials aimed at introducing users to various aspects of statistical modeling with Stan, both
in written and visual formats.  These tutorials can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a></p>

# Case Studies and Notebooks

Case studies provide longer, more-detailed discussion of various
applications, models, and methodologies.  Each case study is written
in knitr or Jupyter notebooks so that the discussion is accompanied
with working code.  Case studies written or validated by the Stan
development team can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/case-studies.html">
  Case Studies</a></p>

The proceedings of each Stan Conference also take the form of
self-contained notebooks.  Contributions for each conference can
be found in their corresponding GibHub repository:

  <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stancon_talks">StanCon 2017 Case Studies</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="note">(GitHub, with video links)</span>
  </p>

# The Stan Forums

The most up to date discussion of modeling techniques and computational
issues if often found in the Stan Forums before it ends up in a case study
or a paper.

* <p><a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
<span class="note">(Discourse)</span></p>

Discussions prior to June 2017 are achived and public on the now deprecated
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/stan-users">Stan Users Google Group</a>.

# Example Models

The quick start guides for each [interface](/users/interfaces/) contain
example models for demonstrating how to run Stan.

The Stan modeling language manual contains many other model examples to
illustrate various modeling and coding techniques in Stan.

A larger set of example models translating the BUGS examples (Volumes
1 through 3) and the models from several Bayesian textbooks are also
available on GibHub,

specific fields.
