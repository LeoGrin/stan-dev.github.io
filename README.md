# Stan Web Site (mc-stan.org)

This is the repository for the Stan web site.  

### Managing the web site

Pushes to master on this branch kick off a Jekyll process on GitHub to rebuild the web site.

If you want to run the web site locally to test changes, see the Wiki page:

https://github.com/stan-dev/stan-dev.github.io/wiki/Using-the-Jeykll-Based-Website

### Contribute 

We take pull requests just as with the rest of the Stan repos.

### Case studies

Adding a case study requires adding a link in the index:

* users/documentation/case-studies.md

and putting the actual HTML of the case study here:

* users/documentation/case-studies/

All case studies must come with a clear indication of copyright holder and separate open-source license for code (we recommend BSD or similar non-copyleft license) and text (we recommend CC BY ND or CC BY NC).
