## [Tutorials](#tutorials)

### Basics of Bayesian inference and Stan. August 11-12 all day. 

Instructor Jonah Gabry.

**Description:**

We will review some of the foundational concepts in Bayesian statistics that are essential background for anyone interested in using Bayesian methods in practice. Then we will introduce the Stan language and the recommended workflow for applied Bayesian data analysis by working through an example analysis together. Since we only have 2 days for this tutorial it will be beneficial for participants to have at least some previous experience with statistical modeling, but prior experience fitting Bayesian models is not a requirement. We will be interfacing with Stan from R, but users of Python and other languages/platforms can still benefit from the tutorial as all of the code we write in the Stan language (and all of the modeling techniques and concepts covered) can be used with any of the Stan interfaces.

### Additional Tutorials

More tutorials to be announced.

We're seeking half-day or full-day proposals for basic or advanced Stan programming or Bayesian modeling topics. The selected tutorials will run on August 11 and 12.
