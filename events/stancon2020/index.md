Please email stancon@mc-stan.org! We ask all volunteers follow the [StanCon code of conduct](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon-code_of_conduct).

### Tutorials, Sessions, Contributed Talks

We're still working out the schedule for tutorials, sessions, and contributed talks. Once we have details, we'll make a request for proposals. For those that plan early:

- Tutorials: we're seeking proposals for half-day or full-day tutorials. These can either be focused on foundations of Stan programming and Bayesian inference or advanced topics that can be for a niche audience. Proposals must describe the content and objectives of the tutorial.

- Sessions: we're seeking proposals for thematic sessions. Sessions run in parallel on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. Sessions will be 5 talks. Proposals must describe the theme, content, and a list of potential speakers.

- Contributed talks: if you'd like to present your work at StanCon 2020, we're looking for people to talk either in the general session or in one of the parallel sessions.

Full details on what, how, and when to submit will be available shortly. If you have any questions or are considering submitting a proposal, feel free to reach out early at stancon@mc-stan.org
