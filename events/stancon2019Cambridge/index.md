# [Tutorials](#tutorials)
<b>Introduction to Stan for the Statistically Literate. </b>August 20, 21 all day. Instructors Jonah Gabry and Lauren Kennedy. 

<b>Description:</b> In this tutorial we will first review some of the foundational concepts in Bayesian statistics that are essential background for anyone interested in using Bayesian methods in practice. Then we will introduce the Stan language and the recommended workflow for applied Bayesian data analysis by working through an example analysis together. Since we only have 2 days for this tutorial it will be beneficial for participants to have at least some previous experience with statistical modeling, but prior experience fitting Bayesian models is not a requirement. 
We will be interfacing with Stan from R, but users of Python and other languages/platforms can still benefit from the tutorial as all of the code we write in the Stan language (and all of the modeling techniques and concepts covered) can be used with any of the Stan interfaces.

**Introduction to Stan for Programmers. No statistics background required.** August 20, 21 mornings with afternoon exercises. R/Python based introduction to both Stan and statistics. Instructors Jonathan Auerbach, Breck Baldwin.

**Description:** This class is for those who don't know statistics but are interested in Bayesian modeling the Stan way. This tutorial will not cover as much ground as the above class but will get you working with the basics of Bayesian modeling so that you can proceed to learn more. Most importantly we get you through the awkward 'no idea phase' of learning a new technology to having a basic understanding of how to work with the software. We will cover the mechanics of how Stan programs work, show simple examples of regression and pooling. We presuppose that you are comfortable with general programming concepts like subroutines, variable assignment and use of IDEs. Both the R and Python interfaces to Stan will be covered. 

**A Dive into Stan’s C++ Model Concept** August 20, afternoon. Instructor Daniel Lee. 

**Description:** This will be a discussion partially driven by the participants. We will cover things like: 

* how the Stan language is translated to C++ 
* overview of the C++ model concept that’s generated 
* how to use the math library for autodiff 
* how to use the generated C++ model concept to write an inference algorithm in C++ 
* opportunities in efficient computing once the C++ is generated

Please be comfortable with C++ or at least be willing to stare at blocks of ugly code. Please have CmdStan installed.

**Hierarchal Modeling with Stan**. August 20, 21 mornings. Instructor Ben Goodrich. 

**Description:** Hierarchical models are and should be the default way to conduct a Bayesian analysis. By hierarchical Bayesian models, we mean any generative process where the distribution for some unknown depends on one or more other unknowns. This includes instrumental variables, interaction terms, hierarchical shrinkage priors and many others. However, the most common instance of a hierarchical model is one where the generative process allows some of the parameters to vary by group, which can be conveniently specified using the syntax of the lme4 R package. In this tutorial we will start with estimating and interpreting estimates of hierarchical models using the stan_glmer function in the rstanarm R package, proceed to the brm function in the brms R package, and finish with some examples where participants modify or write code in the Stan language to specify a hierarchical model. 
Prerequisites: Some experience with R (not necessarily the aforementioned packages) and some experience with MCMC (not necessarily Stan).

**Population and ODE-based models using Stan and Torsten**. August 20, 21 afternoons. Instructors Charles Margossian, Yi Zhang.

**Description** This workshop focuses on examples from pharmacometrics, so familiarity in the subject is helpful. In addition, we will use Torsten, a specialized extension of Stan, which participants should install. That said, the methods discussed apply to other fields: e.g. epidemiology, geology, econometrics, so the core concepts are general. I will review basic notions of pharmacometrics, so that participants from all field can do the exercises.
