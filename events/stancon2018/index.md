# [Scholarships](#scholarships)

We have gotten so many requests for scholarships after the deadline that we are re-opening them. The scholarship covers staying at Asilomar and meals. You are still responsible for travel and incidentals. While this is primarily for students, tell us a good story and we will see what we can do. Scholarship [link here] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScztvDKhyPbyVbZwU3P1667Y-lXh2K2li4p_E5tO-BwvivpPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

# [Wearable Poster Session](#poster)

We will accept poster submissions on a rolling basis until December 5th. One page exclusive of references is the desired format but anything that gives us enough information to make a decision is fine. We will accept/reject within 48 hours. Send to  stancon2018@mc-stan.org. The only somewhat odd requirement is that your poster must be "wearable" to the 5pm reception where you will be a walking presentation. Great way to network, signboard supplies will be available so you need only have sheets of paper which can be attached to signboard material which conincendentally will be the source airframe material for the R/C airplane activities following dinner.

# [Classes](#classes)

We have tutorials that start at the crack of 8am for those desiring further edification beyond the program--these do not run in parallel to the main session but do run parallel to each other:

- Introduction to Stan: Know how to program? Know basic statistics? Curious about Bayesian analysis and Stan? This is the course for you. Hands on, focused and an excellent way to get started working in Stan. Two hours every day, 6 hours total. Bob Carpenter, Jonah Sol Gabry, Ben Goodrich, Sean Talts, Mitzi Morris. 

- Executive decision making the Bayesian way: This is for non-techinical managers to learn the core of decision making under uncertainty and how to interpret the talks that they will be attending the rest of the day. One hour every day. Andrew Gelman, Breck Baldwin.

- Advanced Modeling in Stan: The hard stuff. Very interactive, very intense. Topics vary by day. Bob Carpenter, Jonah Sol Gabry, Andrew Gelman, Ben Goodrich. 

# [Actvities](#activities)
Learning is fun but we anticpate that blowing off a little steam will
be called for. 

##R/C Airplanes

After dinner on day 1 we will provide designs and
building materials to create your own R/C airplane. The core design
can be scratch built in 90 minutes or less at which point, and weather
dependent, we will learn to fly our planes indoors or outdoors. See
http://brooklynaerodrome.com for an idea of the style of airplane. You 
can also create your own designs and we will have night illumination gear. 

##Snob-free Blind Wine Tasting

By day 2 you will have gotten to know your fellow
attendees so some social adventure is called for. This activity has proved wildly 
successful at DARPA conferences and they invented the internet so it can't be all bad. 
Participants taste wines without knowing what they are. The wines are individually evaluated along
many possible dimensions before ultimately being revealed:

- Gues the grape variety, country of origin and vintage for the adventurous.
- What would you pay for another bottle of the wine? 
- What human traits does the wine have? Masculine/feminine? 
- What famous person does the wine resemble?
- What person at the conference does the wine resemble? 


# [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

In order to facilitate a welcoming environment for all attendees, StanCon 2018
will enforce a [code of conduct](/events/stancon2018/stancon-code_of_conduct.html).
