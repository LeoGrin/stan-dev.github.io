# [Scholarships](#scholarships)

Scholarshipes are closed. 
<!--We have gotten so many requests for scholarships after the deadline that we are re-opening them. The scholarship covers staying at Asilomar and meals. You are still responsible for travel and incidentals. While this is primarily for students, tell us a good story and we will see what we can do. Scholarship [link here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScztvDKhyPbyVbZwU3P1667Y-lXh2K2li4p_E5tO-BwvivpPA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
-->

# <a name="poster"></a> [Wearable Poster Session](#poster)

We will accept poster submissions on a rolling basis until January 9th. One page exclusive of references is the desired format but anything that gives us enough information to make a decision is fine. We will accept/reject within min(48 hours,time before reception - 1 hr). Send to stancon2018@mc-stan.org or just come talk to Breck at the conference. The only somewhat odd requirement is that your poster must be "wearable" to the 5pm reception where you will be a walking presentation. Great way to network, signboard supplies will be available so you need only have sheets of paper which can be attached to signboard material.



# [Location](#location)

### [Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, California](https://aws.passkey.com/e/49190400/)

StanCon 2018 will take place at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, a National
Historic Landmark on the Monterey Peninsula right on the beach.

Asilomar is about 120 miles south of San Francisco and 75 miles south
of San Jose. Shuttle service is $60 each way from San Francisco airport (3 hour
trip) and $50 each way from San Jose airport (2 hour trip)
(https://www.montereyairbus.com). Shuttles run approximately every 1.5
hours. Car rental is also an option and showing rates less than $30/day as of Oct 29th.

# [Classes/Tutorials](#classes)

We have tutorials that start at the crack of 7am for those desiring further edification beyond the program--these do not run in parallel to the main session but do run parallel to each other--rooms to be determined (Merrill or Scripps):

- [Introduction to Stan:](#intro) Know how to program? Know basic statistics? Curious about Bayesian analysis and Stan? This is the course for you. Hands on, focused and an excellent way to get started working in Stan. Wed-Fri 8-10am, Thurs 2:30-4:10pm. Jonah Sol Gabry, Mitzi Morris, Sean Talts.

- [Executive decision making the Bayesian way:](#exec) This is for non-technical managers and technical folks who need to communicate with managers to learn the core of decision making under uncertainty. Wed 8-9am, Thurs 3:30-4:10, Friday 8-9am. Jonathan Auerback, Eric Novik.

- [Advanced Hierarchical Models in Stan:](#advanced) The hard stuff. Ben Goodrich. 9-10am Wed, 7-8am Thurs, 7-8am Friday.

- [Model assessment, selection and inference after model selection](#model) The tutorial covers cross-validation, reference predictive and projection predictive approaches for model assessment, selection and inference after model selection. I discuss when cross-validation is useful and when we can do better than cross-validation (and why not to use WAIC).  The tutorial is accommopanied with R notebooks using rstanarm, bayesplot, loo, and projpred packages. You can bring also your own data and model to get recommendations for model assessment and selection. Aki Vehtari, Thurs 8-9am


- [How to develop for Stan at the C++ level:](#develop) Overview of Stan C++ architecture and build/development process for contributors. Charles Margossian, 9-10am Thurs.

- [A Dive into Stan's C++ Model Concept](#dive) This will be a discussion partially driven by the participants. We will cover things like:
	- how the Stan language is translated to C++
	- overview of the C++ model concept that's generated
	- how to use the math library for autodiff
	- how to use the generated C++ model concept to write an inference algorithm in C++
	- opportunities in efficient computing once the C++ is generated

	Please be comfortable with C++ or at least be willing to stare at blocks of ugly code. Please have CmdStan v2.17.1 installed. Daniel Lee, 9-10am Friday.


# [Activities](#activities)
Learning is fun but we anticipate that blowing off a little steam will
be called for.

## ~~R/C Airplanes~~ Now Air Powered Rockets

R/C Airplanes are cancled due to FAA regulation changes in December. In place we will have build your own air powered rockets and they will be carrying night lights. After dinner on Wed eve we will provide designs and
building materials to create your own rocket. It takes about 15 minutes if you are quick and we will have glow sticks to put on them.  

## S'mores By the Bonfire

Pretty much self explanatory. Wed eve.

## Snob-free Blind Wine Tasting

By day 2 you will have gotten to know your fellow
attendees so some social adventure is called for. This activity has proved wildly
successful at DARPA conferences and they invented the internet so it can't be all bad.
Participants taste wines without knowing what they are.


# [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

In order to facilitate a welcoming environment for all attendees, StanCon 2018
will enforce a [code of conduct](/events/stancon2018/stancon-code_of_conduct.html).
