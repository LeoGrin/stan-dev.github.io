## Stan Language Reference Manual

The manual for Stan's programming language for coding probability models,
inference algorithms for fitting models and making predictions,
and posterior analysis tools for evaluating the results.
This manual applies to all Stan interfaces.

## Stan Language Functions Reference

The reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.
For versions 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the _Stan Reference Manual_.

## Bayesian Statistics Using Stan

This book is the official user's guide for Stan.  It provides example
models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
It also serves as an example-driven introduction to Bayesian modeling
and inference.
For version 2.18, this is titled _Stan User's Guide_.
For verson 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the _Stan Reference Manual_.
