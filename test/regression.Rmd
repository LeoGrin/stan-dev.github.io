# Regression Models

Stan supports regression models from simple linear regressions to
multilevel generalized linear models.

## Linear Regression

The simplest linear regression model is the following, with a single
predictor and a slope and intercept coefficient, and normally
distributed noise.  This model can be written using standard
regression notation as
$$
y_n = \alpha + \beta x_n + \epsilon_n
\quad\text{where}\quad
\epsilon_n \sim \operatorname{normal}(0,\sigma).
$$

This is equivalent to the following sampling involving the
residual,
$$
y_n - (\alpha + \beta X_n) \sim \operatorname{normal}(0,\sigma),
$$
and reducing still further, to
$$
y_n \sim \operatorname{normal}(\alpha + \beta X_n, \, \sigma).
$$

This latter form of the model is coded in Stan as follows. Links to source: [R](regression/regression_1.R), [Python](regression/regression_1.py), [Stan](regression/regression_1.stan)

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=""}
library(knitr)
stan_file = read_file('regression/regression_1.stan')

```
data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  vector[N] x;
  vector[N] y;
}
parameters {
  real alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  y ~ normal(alpha + beta * x, sigma);
}
```

There are `N` observations, each with predictor `x[n]` and
outcome `y[n]`.  The intercept and slope parameters are
`alpha` and `beta`.  The model assumes a normally
distributed noise term with scale `sigma`.  This model has
improper priors for the two regression coefficients.

### Matrix Notation and Vectorization {- #vectorization.section}

The sampling statement in the previous model is vectorized, with

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=""}
lines = strsplit(stan_file,"\n")[[1]]
cat(paste(lines[12:12],collapse="\n"))
```
$\color{red}{\text{above, new way excerpts from source code on disk. Rmarkdown code that generates the snippet is:}}$

```{r echo=TRUE, comment=""}
lines = strsplit(stan_file,"\n")[[1]]
cat(paste(lines[12:12],collapse="\n"))
```
