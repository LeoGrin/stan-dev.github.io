who we are

Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software <span
class="note">(new BSD core, some interfaces GPLv3)</span>
for facilitating statistical inference at the frontiers
of applied statistics.

# The Stan Development Team

The project is a team effort comprised of full time and
volunteer developers from around the world.

# Stan Governing Body (SGB)

We have a provisional Stan Governing Body that will operate for 1 year (starting 08/23/2018).

The scope of the SGB’s authority is all things Stan. That includes ownership/management of trademarks, online resources like discourse and GitHub and membership in the Stan community. Additionally the SGB has authority over current NumFOCUS funds, fundraising in support of Stan, defining the scope of Stan, power to create and dissolve non-profit corporate entities for Stan, authorize and/or run StanCons. The SGB controls licensing requirements for inclusion in Stan, e.g. Columbia University has copyright to much of Stan’s code base but it is released under an open source license so it is part of Stan.

The SGB is meant to be a transparent body in service of the Stan community and electorate. The SGB will define an electorate and the governance of joining and participating in an electorate. The SGB is expected to use referendums when appropriate to insure it’s legitimacy. The SGB will publicly post minutes on a regular basis on http://discourse.mc-stan.org General category.

The SGB is to advance diversity in under-represented communities in the Stan ecosystem. The SGB will actively develop and implement strategies to improve inclusion and diversity at all levels of the Stan project and will prepare an annual diversity report.

The composition of the non-provisional SGB will be established through half-board elections every year. Any changes to the electorate will be approved by majority vote of the existing electorate.

To reach the current SGB with any questions, concerns, or feedback, please email <board@mc-stan.org>.

The current SGB (09/05/2018) is:

* Breck Baldwin <span class="note">(Columbia University)</span> [Presiding officer]
* Julie Bertrand  <span class="note">(INSERM)</span>
* Michael Betancourt <span class="note">(Independent consultant)</span>
